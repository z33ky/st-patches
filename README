My patches for [st](st.suckless.org).

#### `st-apc-cwd-20170717-8dacdfb.diff`

Adds an Application Control Command to set the cwd.
I created this to be used together with `tabbed-keep-cwd-20170228-bc23614.diff` from [tabbed-patches](/z33ky/tabbed-patches).
You can override the `cd` command of your shell, or for `zsh` you can also use `function chpwd`, and just do `echo -ne "\033_0;${PWD}\007"` from there.
